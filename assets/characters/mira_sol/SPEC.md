## 1. Identity (verbatim from `resources/data/characters.json`)

| field | value |
| --- | --- |
| id | `mira_sol` |
| display_name | Mira Sol |
| title | Squire of the Golden Gate |
| race | Human |
| element | light |
| rarity | common |
| role | Tank |

These identity fields are reproduced exactly so that
`CharacterArtSpec.for_id("mira_sol").race == ContentDB.get_character("mira_sol").race` (and the other five fields) hold.

## 2. Palette (exact from `characters.json`)

| role | hex |
| --- | --- |
| `hair` | `#e8c27a` |
| `primary` | `#c9d2e0` |
| `secondary` | `#d9b45c` |
| `accent` | `#fff0b8` |
| `skin` | `#f0cbb0` |

- **hair_color:** `#e8c27a (warm wheat-gold)`

## 3. Authored art direction (consistent shared anime-fantasy style)

- **physical_appearance:** Sturdy, earnest young human with a square jaw, a few faint freckles, steady grey-gold eyes and the upright posture of someone who still stands watch.
- **hair_style:** Practical wheat-gold bob tucked under a squire's cap, with a short braid at one temple.
- **hair_color:** #e8c27a (warm wheat-gold)
- **outfit:** Well-kept but unknighted steel-blue gambeson with brass buttons, a plain tabard bearing no crest, dented pauldrons and sturdy boots.
- **accessories:** A blank shield with an empty crest-space, a worn oath-ribbon tied at the wrist and a small brass gate-key.
- **weapon:** A broad kite shield and a short, honest sword - defensive gear, not a hero's blade.
- **personality:** Dutiful, unglamorous and steadfast; she keeps an oath to a kingdom that ran out of knights before it ran out of wars.
- **visual_theme:** Humble steel-and-dawn squire; plain gate-and-shield motifs, a pale dawn-gold accent, a simple honest rounded silhouette (ordinary COMMON tier, no ornamentation).
- **visual tier:** standard (no premium ornamentation).

Shared direction (all 12): ~6-head heroic proportions, upper-left key light, a 1-2 px dark ink outline,
cel-shaded painterly rendering, transparent RGBA8 backgrounds and element-motif accents; original
characters only, no copyrighted references.
