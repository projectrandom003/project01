## 1. Identity (verbatim from `resources/data/characters.json`)

| field | value |
| --- | --- |
| id | `thistle` |
| display_name | Thistle |
| title | Lantern of Small Wishes |
| race | Spirit |
| element | wind |
| rarity | rare |
| role | Support |

These identity fields are reproduced exactly so that
`CharacterArtSpec.for_id("thistle").race == ContentDB.get_character("thistle").race` (and the other five fields) hold.

## 2. Palette (exact from `characters.json`)

| role | hex |
| --- | --- |
| `hair` | `#f2e2a8` |
| `primary` | `#3f5a6b` |
| `secondary` | `#8fd9c4` |
| `accent` | `#ffeaa0` |
| `skin` | `#f6e3cf` |

- **hair_color:** `#f2e2a8 (pale wishlight gold)`

## 3. Authored art direction (consistent shared anime-fantasy style)

- **physical_appearance:** Small, translucent wisp-spirit with a softly glowing slightly see-through body, tiny floating feet, a faint halo of warm lantern-light and edges that blur into motes.
- **hair_style:** A cloud of pale wishlight-gold hair that drifts upward like dandelion fluff.
- **hair_color:** #f2e2a8 (pale wishlight gold)
- **outfit:** A simple dusky-blue hooded tunic with mint edging, a little satchel and a hem that fades into sparkles rather than cloth.
- **accessories:** The Wish-Lantern - a small brass lantern full of glowing abandoned wishes - plus a chain of tiny paper wishes.
- **weapon:** No weapon: the lantern itself, whose light grants small miracles.
- **personality:** Timid, tender and hopeful; she collects abandoned wishes and lights them for anyone who has run out of hope.
- **visual_theme:** Warm wishlight wisp; lantern, dandelion-seed and paper-wish motifs, a soft mint-and-gold glow, a small rounded glowing silhouette.
- **visual tier:** standard (no premium ornamentation).

Shared direction (all 12): ~6-head heroic proportions, upper-left key light, a 1-2 px dark ink outline,
cel-shaded painterly rendering, transparent RGBA8 backgrounds and element-motif accents; original
characters only, no copyrighted references.
